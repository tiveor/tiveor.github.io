After 10 years programming as professional, I’m starting a new challenge with the creation of this Personal Blog.
So, in this blog, I’ll be providing interesting topics about programming, code and some thoughts that I think could be helpful with all folks and followers.

Finally, Let's begin, so:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_status(coming)
  puts "Winter is #{coming}"
end
print_status('here')
{% endhighlight %}
