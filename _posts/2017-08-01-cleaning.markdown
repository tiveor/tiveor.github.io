I'm cleaning out all my digital garbage from my macbooks, hard-drives and external hard-drives,
I know that this can be a lot of work since I always has been liked to do many activities in parallel
like programming, music, learning and reading topics. Some way I'm decrypting myself. <br/><br/>

{% highlight java %}
    public static byte[] decrypt(byte[] encrypted) throws Exception {
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(algorithm);
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, getSecret());
        return cipher.doFinal(encrypted);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

<br/>

<p>
Certainly, I have many things to put in the garbage and some others to restore from a forgotten secret place to a priority list.
I think, It will take me long time, but we'll see, and I'll be posting here any "valuable" code lost in the shadows.<br/><br/>

Since we are talking about cleaning, I'll let you this small video that suggests you how to write clean code and with good book readings.
