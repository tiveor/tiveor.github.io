I'm cleaning out all my garbage literally, physic and digitally from my mind to my PC, so this is being kind of a lot of work since I like to do many things in code, music, investigation, learn things, read a lot, and so on.

So, this day can be counted as day off. I have many things to put the garbage and put things back from a forgot secret place to a priority list.


I think, I could take me a while, but we'll see.
