I'm cleaning out all my garbage literally, physic and digitally from my mind to my PC, so this is being kind of a lot of work since I like to do many things in code, music, investigation, learn things, read a lot, and so on.


{% highlight java %}
    public static byte[] decrypt(byte[] encrypted) throws Exception {
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(algorithm);
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, getSecret());
        return cipher.doFinal(encrypted);
    }
{% endhighlight %}

[EncryptorHelper.java](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiveor/oneway/master/src/main/java/tive/security/EncryptorHelper.java){:target="_blank"}

<br/>
So, this day can be counted as day off. I have many things to put the garbage and put things back from a forgot secret place to a priority list.


I think, It would take me awhile, but we'll see.
