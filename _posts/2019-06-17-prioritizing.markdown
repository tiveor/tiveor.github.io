<i>“Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”</i><br/>
― Steve Jobs

So actually, this blog it was not in my top priority list for a long time, but now and in a progressive way, this is taking too many importance since I've decided to be posting frequently and keep disclosing some projects, github repositories, technologies, courses, thoughts, that take my day to day

Don't forget and keep prioritizing your Life. Don't live to live!. Live intentionally!
