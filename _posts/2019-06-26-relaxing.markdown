A way that I usually relax myself, is when I'm playing the piano. I've started learning from a classical piano school when I was 9 years old. I was playing Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Rachmaninoff so on so for. I had an bolivian-european school, my teacher Nadia was a Conservatory master Russian that grow me to a level that I never thought to get it. When I've graduated I was in the middle of decide if I will study music or engineering. I didn't decide study music taking in count that in Bolivia is not too normal or lucrative do music as a profession. After a family reflection I discovered that like I was loving piano keyboards I was also loving the computer keyboards. So, I finally studied Systems Engineering, that is something too similar to Computer Science in other countries. <br/><br/>

In the previous video I'm playing piano in my clandestine channel. Is clandestine since is not too well seen that I play popular songs from ear for classical teachers and partners, but I developed this ability during the years, that allow me to be in touch at least this way with the music.
